  <h3>The big lie</h3>
  <p>We've all heard how sausages have to be creepy, correct? This is perpetuated by snobby chefs who take their advice from century old cookbooks revered in the cathedrals of Olden Frank Fort. However, more and more people are embracing the opposite aspect: wet. In this guide, you'll learn how to get that healthy gloss on your favorite cold cut.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Glizzy (Sausage)</li>
    <li>Water</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Grab the right sausage. This is very important, as the opener sausage sets the mood for the evening. A hearthier sausage will travel you to the old swaps of yore, while a more spice-heavy sausage will slither around like the snake that gave an apple onto Eve and Adam. This is what we call the <strong>Sausage Gambit</strong>. You'll learn more about it in the advanced course.</li>
    <li>Do the <abbr title="Glizzy Ablations">GAs</abbr> as per usual. Your hands should be wet in water and not ash, though. This is what we call the antimetabolic glizzy ablation. Don't worry, it's just a fancy term for wet ablation. Make sure to take your time.</li>
    <li>Dip the sausage in the water. If you have done the steps correctly, your sausage should now be a fantastic conversation opener to all your friends and family on the next meat festival.</li>
